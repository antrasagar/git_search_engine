## Setting up the code
   1. git clone the repository
   2. Open terminal and run "*npm install*". This will download and install all the required dependencies.
   3. On the terminal run "*npm start*" for running the application.
   4. Application will run on default port 4200.
   5. Go to browser and enter "*http://localhost:4200/*"
   6. In order to run the test cases, run "*ng test*" in the terminal.
   7. For test case coverage run "*ng test --watch=false --code-coverage*" in the terminal.
